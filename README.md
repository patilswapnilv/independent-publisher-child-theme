Independent Publisher Child Theme
===========================

This child theme can be used to override styles and features of the [Independent Publisher](http://independentpublisher.me) theme. For a complete list of functions you can override in this child theme, please see [Functions you can override in a Child Theme](https://github.com/raamdev/independent-publisher#functions-you-can-override-in-a-child-theme).

## Installation

This [Child Theme](http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes) requires the parent Independent Publisher theme, so be sure that you have that installed first. Then, simply download this child theme and place it your `wp-content/themes/` folder and then activate it from **Appearance â†’ Themes**.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** If you downloaded the Independent Publisher theme from GitHub, the theme folder name might be `independent-publisher-master`. If that is the case, _you must_ rename the theme directory to `independent-publisher`, as that is what the Child Theme looks for.

Once this Child Theme has been activated, you can start making changes to the child theme's `style.css` file and/or `functions.php`. The changes you make in those files will simply override the parent theme's styles and functions.

See the comments in `style.css` and `functions.php` for examples.

## Templates

A [Page Template](http://codex.wordpress.org/Page_Templates#Custom_Page_Template) can be selected from the Page Attributes meta box when editing or creating a new WordPress Page. The following page templates are included in this Child Theme:

 * **Archive Page:** Displays Search box, Recent Posts, Most Used Categories, Monthly Archives, and Tag Cloud.
